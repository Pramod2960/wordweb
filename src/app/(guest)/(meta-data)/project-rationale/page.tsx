         >A dictionary archives lexical growth of a language. More precisely, it records new words and their usage as they come into existence. The reason of lexical growth or outnumbering words in a language is not only testimony to the fact that language changes diachronically (across the time) but also because the new words keep on evolving due to advancement and new perspectives in different spheres of life such as science, technology, law, culture, management, sports, etc. The knowledge of new words in today’s fast changing world is indispensable not only in having higher language proficiency in global academia but also in facilitating smoother integration into diverse cultural and social environments.  </p>

        According to the Global Language Monitor (GLM) there are roughly 1,019,729 words in English language and one new cord is coined almost every 98 minutes globally. Keeping in mind the fast growing new words, this project aims at creating a dictionary of 3000 newly coined words in the past ten years and make one aware of them for daily use. To be more precise, the current project is an endeavour to firstly list up evolving new words, phrases, and expressions of English language followed by finding their Sanskrit equivalents along with their definitions and contextual usage.
