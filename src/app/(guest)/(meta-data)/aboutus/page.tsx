         >We are a joint entity representing Central Sanskrit University and Amity University Haryana to carry out the present project called Shabdshala (Wordweb) at Amity Centre for Sanskrit and Indic Studies, Amity School of Liberal Arts under the aegis of Amity University Haryana. The present Wordweb project, a pivotal component of the Ashtaadashi scheme sponsored by Central Sanskrit University, strives to bring new life to the ancient Sanskrit language by creating an electronic lexicon lexical database of 3000 new English words and their corresponding Sanskrit equivalents. Language is an ever-evolving living entity, and English, being one of the worlds most widely spoken languages, constantly adapts to changes in society, technology, and culture. </p>

         New words are regularly introduced to describe emerging concepts, innovations, and developments in various fields. As the Sanskrit language carries with it a rich history and tradition, the idea of creating Sanskrit usages for new English words introduced since 2013 is an innovative and transformative undertaking. For the purpose of preserving Sanskrit language at par with English and making it more accessible in the modern world in terms of lexical equivalents, this dictionary project (nicknamed as Wordweb) aims to incorporate contemporary new English words added under official websites of Oxford English Dictionary, Cambridge Dictionary, Merriam Webster English Dictionary, Dictionary.com, and three authentic web sources. This report presents an overview of the ongoing three years project called Wordweb under five headings: project rationale, objectives, methodology, outcome, and wayforward as follows:
